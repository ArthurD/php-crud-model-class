php-crud-model-class
====================

An extremely light-weight base class that can be extended to very quickly &amp; easily create basic CRUD-capable models in PHP.


## Usage 
See example.php for an example of usage or just read through base_model itself (it's very straight-forward).

## Other...

*Caching* - It's pretty trivial to add Memcache (or any other similar key-value cache) on top of this.

*Model Associations* - Nope.  Feel free to add it.  :-)  

*PHP Version* - Should work on anything 5+ but may require 5.3+ (the intent is 5.3+).

*Contributing* - Please submit pull requests!  I'll do my best to help you with any pull requests or issues.
